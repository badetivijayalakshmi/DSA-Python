# Queue Notes

## What is a Queue?
FIFO data structure where the first inserted element
is removed first.

## When to use Queue
- Order matters
- Scheduling
- Level-wise processing
- Sliding window

## Python Implementation
Use collections.deque for O(1) operations.

Using collections.deque (BEST)
from collections import deque

q = deque()
q.append(10)      # enqueue
q.popleft()       # dequeue


✅ O(1) enqueue & dequeue

## Sliding Window Template

- Used when processing fixed-size subarrays
- Deque stores indices, not values
- Front always holds the answer
- Remove:
  - expired elements from front
  - useless elements from back

Time: O(n)
Space: O(k)
